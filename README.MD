## SO LONG 42

An implementation of the 42 project so_long with all bonus.  
It has animations (kind of), an enemy patroling and nice textures with varying trees as walls.  

You need minilibx installed to be able to play this game. 
Don't have it? 42Paris has a nice installation guide.
It also provides some maps you can test around with.  

Error handling is done accordingly.


Concepts which may be interesting for you:
- Using mlx_loop_hook to get arbitrary numbers (they are **not** random)
- Use static to save variable references (look as example in the free function in main.c) (I actually don't think this is good practice at ALL)

> Please do not copy this project straight. It put this public for other people to learn because it would helped me if there  
> is more available and so you can get an idea how you could solve the problems you will encounter.  

> The graphics/textures are mine. if you use them, it'd be nice if you credit me in your README if you publish the game like I did.

Final score: 120/120

Memory leaks: None I would be aware of :D
